            <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
            <p>As a passionate fourth-year IT student, I am actively seeking internship opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to meaningful projects. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated strong cooperative skills, including a love for teamwork and collaboration. My ability to multitask effectively allows me to thrive in dynamic environments.
                <br>
                During my previous internship at the Madhya Pradesh State Electronics and Development Corporation, I had the privilege of being recognized as the “Best Intern of the Month.” In this role, I prepared and presented detailed reports for senior management, highlighting key findings and recommendations. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I analyzed data to identify trends and insights. Additionally, I spearheaded the development of wireframes using industry-standard tools like Axure, translating business requirements into intuitive user interfaces. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of effective communication and stakeholder engagement.
                <br>
                Apart from my internship, I have also delved into Kajabi development, designing custom themes and templates to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Integrating third-party plugins further enhanced the functionality of Kajabi platforms. Collaborating closely with clients, I ensured personalized solutions aligned with their specific requirements.
                <br>
                Currently pursuing an Integrated Master’s in Computer Application from Devi Ahilya Vishwavidhyalaya, Indore, I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. My coursework also covers database management, software engineering, and web development.
                <br>
                Outside of the tech world, I am passionate about learning Spanish and exploring new horizons. Whether it’s solving complex problems or creating elegant web designs, I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and a growth mindset.
                <br>
                Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or explore my portfolio here. Let’s collaborate and make a positive impact together.</p>
